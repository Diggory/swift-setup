# Fedora

[**Fedora**](https://getfedora.org) is not the first version of Linux to support Swift, but _is_ the first version to have a native package for easy installation.


To install Swift on Fedora, open the **Terminal** program and run the following command:

```
sudo dnf install -y swift-lang
```

> **Note**: This command requires administrator privileges, so itâ€™ll ask for your password.

You can now execute the `swift` command to verify which version you have installed:

```
swift --version
```
