# Swift Setup

This repository describes how you can set up a development environment for the [Swift programming language](https://swift.org).

Our goal is to support the adoption of Swift as a general purpose cross-platform programming language in education. To that end, we provide student-friendly instructions for various platforms, editors, and IDEs that support Swift.

## Platforms

- [macOS](platforms/macOS/README.md)
- [Ubuntu 20.04](platforms/ubuntu-2004/README.md)

## Editors and IDEs

- [Gedit (Ubuntu)](editors/gedit/README.md)
- [Visual Studio Code (Ubuntu)](editors/vscode-ubuntu/README.md)
- [Xcode (macOS)](editors/xcode/README.md)
